Then copy the [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SethClydesdale/fa-toolbar-share/master/share_buttons.js) into the textarea and save. By default, this should enable three new share buttons ; Pinterest, Tumblr, and Reddit. As well as a few extra buttons that are disabled, and some tooltips added to each button.
